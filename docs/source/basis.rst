Priorities
##########
Similar to the other part of the input file in BAGH, the basis set assignment is case and space insensitive (as long as different keywords are separated). There are 3 ways basis sets are assigned to different atoms in BAGH:
1. Atom-specific basis sets
2. Custom basis set
3. Universal basis set
The hghest priority is given to the atom-specific basis sets and the lowest goes to the universal basis set assignment. If no basis set is assigned to an atom, by default STO-3G is assigned to it.
